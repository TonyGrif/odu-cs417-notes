# Least-Squares Approximation
Least-squares approximation is a collection of methods to approximate a best-fit function for a **global** trend given a collection of points. 
## Summation vs. Integral
Utilize summation when calculating for discrete values; use integrals when calculating for continuous values.
## Notation
* $\varphi$ is a possible approximation function; $\hat\varphi$ is the best possible approximation function.
* $\phi_n$ is the set of all approximation functions that can be expressed as a linear combination of $n$ basis functions.
## Basis Functions
These are the linear combinations of other functions that determine the polynomial degree (or other behavior) of the approximation function.
